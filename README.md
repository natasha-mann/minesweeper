# Minesweeper üí£

Before we take a break from grid-based challenges, your dastardly dare for this week is to recreate the logic behind the classic [Minesweeper](https://minesweeper.online/) game. Given a grid of characters where each `X` represents a mine and each `-` represents empty space, the aim is to return a grid where each `-` is replaced by an integer indicating the number of mines adjacent to that spot (including diagonally).

Rewards:

5Ô∏è‚É£ Points are awarded for a working solution.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for creating a playable game (i.e. a working GUI).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for creating more than one difficulty level in your playable game.
